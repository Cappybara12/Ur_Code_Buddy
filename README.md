# Ur_code_buddy
I have created a site named Ur_code_buddy which houses various important aspects which an early coder requires to start his journey .
It consists of various courses from which the person can look for depending on his needs and addresses his requirements . It requires more work and we are planning to do more such as adding a communiyt for coders and also various coding competitions so that a person dont have to wander in his journey.
